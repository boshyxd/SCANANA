# SCANANA

## Short Description
Explore a mysterious environment with your high-tech LIDAR scanner that has one critical malfunction - it's allergic to bananas! Scan the terrain to complete your mission, but be careful: that innocent-looking banana could trigger a total system crash!

## Game Description
SCANANA is a unique first-person exploration game where you use LIDAR technology to scan and analyze your environment. But there's a catch - your scanner has developed a bizarre malfunction that makes it extremely sensitive to bananas!

Your mission is to scan 80% of the terrain while carefully avoiding a mysterious banana that threatens to corrupt your entire system. Use multiple scan modes to navigate and map the environment, watching as your scanner creates beautiful point cloud visualizations of everything you survey.

As you progress, keep an eye on two critical metrics: your terrain scanning progress and the banana contamination level. If you accidentally scan too much of the banana, your system will begin to glitch and malfunction, eventually leading to a catastrophic system failure!
